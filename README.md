# What is this?
This is a collection of python scripts built to ease use and enable refined measurements using an SDR dongle compatible with librtlsdr. It uses matplotlib to plot results acquired from a scan using _rtl_power_fftw_, as well as enabling set-and-forget measurements using a Raspberry Pi, which can later be loaded in the program for measurements.

# Features and goals
